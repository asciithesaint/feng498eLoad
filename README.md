This is a constant current electronic load which contrelled with a Windows form app gui.
Project report can be read to understand electronic design, gui and arduino code. Total design is as simple as it gets.
Lastly, forgotten to add, empty opamp inputs in LT1014 should be short to ground. Up and down current values(0-50mA) could be resulted by this and not-tuned 
feedback of comparator opamp. But, gui works fine it can be used with different designs.
Main part to understand this project is methodology in project report.

## GUI
